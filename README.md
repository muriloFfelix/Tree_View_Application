# Tree_View_Application

A basic Flutter app for visualizing the assets contained on company units through a interactive tree view structure.

The app counts with 3 filter options: one based on status, one based on sensor type and one search bar for the assets names.

## Improvement points

Initially, adding filters for the remaining status and sensor type would dispose even more views of the tree structure. With further time available, a third screen for displaying details of each asset/location present would improve significantly the utility of the application. Having even more liberty on the development, changing the assets displayed from .png to .svg would guarantee a smoother look for the UI.

While GetX was my choice for state management in this project, I recognize there are better and more reliable libraries for such role, given the fact it's been over a year since it's last update. One possible alternative would be the use of Bloc.

In the possibility of improving the API, I would personally increase and enhance the calls for assets and locations in a way that could transfer all the filtering algorithms to the back-end side of the operation.
